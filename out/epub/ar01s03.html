            that's what the HDMI wall plug is talking to. There also appears to be a HDMI to DVI or
            VGA transition taking place.</p><p>When Kevin plugged his laptop into the HDMI, the laptop display resolution was set to
            1280 x 800 with no options.</p><p>When connecting to the VGA wallplug, the EDID that his laptop saw comes up as "DW6300"
            or something like that, presumably straight from the projector. When connecting to the
            HDMI wall plug, his laptop reports "Extron" from the DTP-HDMI transmitter/receiver or
            the HDMI-DVI adapter.</p></div></body></html>
